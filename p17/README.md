# Markov Generator

> by Kenny Peluso

Run script:

`cargo build ; cargo run`

## TODO

1. Create separate module for handling "strings of words separated by single spaces" with a struct all string formatting-relating functions as methods.
2. Proper testing.
3. More robust punctuation filtering / word formatting (esp. Line 49).
